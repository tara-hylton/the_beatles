I found this dataset on Kaggle and thought it would be fun to work with but it ended up taking a lot of time and thought, which is good, I guess, LOL. 
I started with one notebook but ended up splitting into 2, so that is why there are 3 total showing. The ones with matplotlib and seaborn in the names are the final work.
